Because the galaxy is so big, and changes so slowly, we cannot directly see how this warp is changing over time. Theoretical models lead us to expect that the warp is a long-lasting, stable structure in the galaxy, and is only moving very slowly. However, we can now measure the velocities of large numbers of stars in the warp, and these are not consistent with a warp having a stable shape. The warp appears to precess around the galaxy as fast as the stars themselves are moving! We need to understand why this is happening. One possibility is that the warp is not long lasting but is instead the response to a recent interaction with another Galaxy.")

        **Overview:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tabs above all briefly contain an explanation with the context behind why that specific piece of analysis was carried out as well as how it links to our overall results within the project. These go in order from the initial plots showing a general picture to more in-depth comparisons as we progress.
        
        **User Input Features:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are referring to the select boxes that appear under each title. They are there for the user to be able to have the option to view the data in a more personalised way and is more convenient for filtering and sorting the data that we want to be presented. For example, selecting an R value of 8.5 will filter the dataset so that only information and rows with an 8.5 value in the radius column are displayed on the chosen graph.
        
        **Other Interactive Features:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as the standard select boxes, this tool consists of various other interactive features too. Items such as sliders help enable the user to engage with the data better and understand how graphs change over time with the year slider. There are also sections of the tool where the user can input numbers to specify a set interval, so we can customise the best-suited axis for certain graphs to optimise the smoothness of the data. As a result, we can gain a better insight into what is happening with the warp.
        
        **Saving Features:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, in addition to the adjusting features within certain graphs, there‚Äôs the ability to save the graph that‚Äôs created using the save graph button. This will save the graph as an image, which can then be shared amongst fellow researchers. Plus, each saved graph can be viewed in the custom graphs tab in more detail within the Streamlit app.

        st.markdown(
        """
        The sine curves have been fitted by filtering down to a specific R value and year and by looping over all of these we plot phi values on the x axis (between 0 and 350 degrees) and then either height or velocity on the y axis. Once these data points are plotted then we use a package called curve fit to find the optimum parameters for our sine function. 

        A sine function has parameters A,B,C,D where the function is Asin(Bx+C)+D. However for this project I chose to only use A,C and D values without changing the frequency. The reason for this is because for a specific year and R value, the phi values range from 0 to 360, so if they frequency/period of the sine wave changed for each year, this wouldnt match up and be consistent overtime.
        
        Furthermore, I added an uncertainty factor when calculating the fit. This takes into account that the data might not be 100% accurate and was created by using a value 1/sqrt(N) where N is the number of particles in the bin.

        Overall, this is then what has been added to the original data frame as extra columns for both height and velocity as A_height, C_height, D_height, A_velocity, C_velocity, and D_velocity columns. This is where A is the Amplitude of the cuve, C is the phase shift and D is the vertical shift of the curve.

        **What amplitude represents:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amplitude of the galactic warp, represented by the height data , shows how pronounced the warp is. A higher amplitude means a greater deviation of stars and gas from the galactic plane. This helps us track how the warps strength changes over time, especially after events like a dwarf galaxy passing by.
        
        **Variation with Radius:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The warps amplitude typically varies with distance from the galactic centre. Generally, the warp is more pronounced in the outer regions of the galaxy because they are less tightly bound and more affected by disturbances. By examining this variation, we can understand how different parts of the galaxy respond to the same disturbance. The pattern for overtime is consistent across radii as the general shape follows through with varying magnitudes as you get to the outer regions.
        
        **Evolution Over Time:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring how amplitude changes at various radii over time can reveal if the warp is growing, decaying, or remaining stable. For instance, after a significant perturbation, the amplitude might initially increase and then gradually decrease if the warp is relaxing. Alternatively, a continuous increase might indicate a persistent or escalating warp. From the above graph after the dwarf galaxy interacts with the Milky Way like galaxy, an increase in amplitude at different radii is seen, which indicates that the warp is being affected by the gravitational disturbance. In this interaction we can see that the warps amplitude is fluctuating! Sometimes either decreasing, suggesting a return to stability, but also sometimes increasing, indicating that the warp is becoming more pronounced at certain points in time. On the whole this accentuates the fact that the warp is more complicated and more factors are at play.

        **What amplitude represents:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amplitude of vertical velocity reflects how fast the particles are moving to keep up with the warp. Higher velocity amplitudes indicate more vigorous motion within the warp, which helps us understand the dynamics and how it affected the warps evolution.
        
        **Variation with Radius:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly the amplitude for velocity shows similar patterns to height for different radii as the two are correlated this is expected.
        
        **Evolution Over Time:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initial spike after 0.1 Gyr indicates that the warp is not only being induced but that the particles within the galaxy are moving more to keep up with the warp in response to the gravitational interaction. After the initial perturbation, the velocity amplitude might either decrease, suggesting the galaxy is returning to a more stable state, or continue to grow, indicating that the warp's dynamic motion is escalating.

        **What phase shift represents:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phase shift shows how the peaks and troughs of the warp‚Äôs height are aligned with angular positions in the galaxy, as well as reveals how the speed of upward and downward motion aligns with angular positions.  Consistent phase shifts across different radii suggest uniform behaviour, while varying phase shifts indicate how the warp‚Äôs vertical displacement and velocity evolves or propagates over time. This helps us understand how the warp‚Äôs structure and alignment change, particularly in response to external perturbations like the passage of a dwarf galaxy.
        
        **Variation with Radius:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phase shift of height varies with distance from the galactic centre, showing a general pattern where the phase shift tends to take longer to sync at larger radii. The phase shifts of height at velocity at different radii show very similar trends however they slightly lag behind each other. This observation could be because the peak and curve of the warp has the potential to be different for each radius and the warp is also moving where the particles are moving to keep up and therefore the particles following it around take longer to get to the same point.
        
        **Evolution Over Time:**  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, phase shifts for both height and velocity fluctuate broadly (0-360 degrees) as the system adjusts to disturbances. Over time, these shifts stabilize to a narrower range apart from at outer radii. This suggests that the warp‚Äôs vertical displacement stabilizes after initial perturbations and that perhaps outer regions of the galaxy exhibit more pronounced and delayed responses compared to the inner regions.

    st.write('The analysis of the data for radii from 5.5 to 15.5 kpc from the galactic center reveals a progression in the behavior of ripples as the radius increases. For smaller radii (5.5 kpc), the ripples after the object passes are small in height and gradually shift from 230 to 300 degrees, with only minor changes in size. As the radius increases to 10.5 kpc and beyond, these ripples become more pronounced, growing in height and taking longer to stabilize. Particularly at 13.5 kpc, the ripples exhibit significant negative heights, peaking at -13.967 and taking longer to settle, a pattern that persists and intensifies at 14.5 and 15.5 kpc, where the maximum height reaches -16.178. These observations suggest that the warp in the galactic disk becomes more pronounced at larger radii, with increasing ripple height and longer periods before stabilization, indicating a stronger and more complex warp effect as one moves further from the center. This trend suggests that the outer regions of the galaxy experience more impact due to the interaction.')
